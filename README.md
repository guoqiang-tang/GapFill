# GapFill
This code package is designed to infill and reconstruct missing values in precipitation and temperature observations from station data. Based on this package, we developed a serially complete dataset (SCD) of precipitation, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature from 1979 to 2018 over North America. The dataset is available on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3735534).
